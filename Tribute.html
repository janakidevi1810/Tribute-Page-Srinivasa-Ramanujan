        <p class="description1">In 1910, Ramanujan met deputy collector V. Ramaswamy Aiyer,
            who founded the Indian Mathematical Society. Wishing for a job at the
            revenue department where Aiyer worked, Ramanujan showed him his mathematics
            notebooks. As Aiyer later recalled: I was struck by the extraordinary
            mathematical results contained in [the notebooks]. I had no mind to
            smother his genius by an appointment in the lowest rungs of the
            revenue department. Aiyer sent Ramanujan, with letters of
            introduction, to his mathematician friends in Madras. Some of them
            looked at his work and gave him letters of introduction to R.
            Ramachandra Rao, the district collector for Nellore and the secretary
            of the Indian Mathematical Society. Rao was impressed by Ramanujan's
            research but doubted that it was his own work. Ramanujan mentioned a
            correspondence he had with Professor Saldhana, a notable Bombay
            mathematician, in which Saldhana expressed a lack of understanding of
            his work but concluded that he was not a fraud. Ramanujan's friend C.
            V. Rajagopalachari tried to quell Rao's doubts about Ramanujan's
            academic integrity. Rao agreed to give him another chance, and
            listened as Ramanujan discussed elliptic integrals, hypergeometric
            series, and his theory of divergent series, which Rao said ultimately
            convinced him of Ramanujan's brilliance. When Rao asked him what he
            wanted, Ramanujan replied that he needed work and financial support.
            Rao consented and sent him to Madras. He continued his research with
            Rao's financial aid. With Aiyer's help, Ramanujan had his work
            published in the Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society.</p>
